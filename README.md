## Ada Tech School project : Dataviz and API

### Description
A small website to [visualize](https://www.chartjs.org/) traffic conditions in the city of Nantes in real time thanks to data collected from an awesome [API](https://data.nantesmetropole.fr/explore/dataset/244400404_fluidite-axes-routiers-nantes-metropole/information/)

### Usage
    # Download using CLI (Or download zip version and skip this step)
    git clone git@github.com:Hidouen/Ada.Meteo_Trafic_Nantes.git

    # Move to the project directory using CLI (or with GUI)
    cd Ada.Meteo_Trafic_Nantes

    # Open the project in your default browser using CLI (or double click on the index.html file)
    open index.html

You can now enjoy it !

### How ?
[Marine](https://github.com/Marine-Dlf), [Romain](https://github.com/Rom3007) and I carried out this project at Ada Tech School in a 2-week sprint using [Agile methodology](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) :

* Daily
* A [Kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) to feed the backlog, cut out tasks and distribute them to each other
* Some features implemented using [mob or pair programming](https://medium.com/bgl-tech/mobbing-vs-pair-programming-3eb1e387183d)
* [MVP](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/minimum-viable-product) and short iterations
* [Demo](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/sprint-demo)
* [Retro](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective)
